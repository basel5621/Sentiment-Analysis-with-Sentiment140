# Sentiment Analysis with 1 Million Dataset

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that utilizes a dataset with over 1 million samples. The analysis covers data exploration, preprocessing, and model training for sentiment classification. The project is broken down into two main Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying text data into different sentiment categories (e.g., positive or negative). The workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, and training a machine learning model on a large dataset.

## Files in the Repository

1. **Exploration_and_Preprocessing.ipynb**  
   This notebook is responsible for the initial analysis and preparation of the dataset. It includes:
   - Loading and exploring the dataset.
   - Data cleaning (e.g., removing missing or invalid entries).
   - Text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, removing stopwords, etc.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualizations of class distributions, word frequencies, etc.

2. **training_model.ipynb**  
   This notebook focuses on training the sentiment analysis model. It covers:
   - Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
   - Model training and evaluation (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
   - Saving the trained model for future use.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Sentiment Dataset with 1 Million Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tariqsays/sentiment-dataset-with-1-million-tweets)

This dataset contains over 1 million labeled tweets, where each tweet is associated with a sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral). The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned, making it suitable for sentiment classification tasks. Key features of the dataset include:
- **Text (Tweets)**: The actual tweet content.
- **Sentiment Labels**: Categories such as positive, negative, or neutral that represent the sentiment of each tweet.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle and follow the instructions in the `Exploration_and_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to preprocess it for training.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- `sklearn` for model training and evaluation.
- `nltk` or `spaCy` for natural language processing tasks.

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
```

## Running the Project

1. **Exploration and Preprocessing**:  
   Run the `Exploration_and_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset and preprocess the text data. This step prepares the data for modeling by cleaning and transforming the raw text.

2. **Model Training**:  
   Once the data is prepared, use the `training_model.ipynb` notebook to train a sentiment analysis model. The notebook will guide you through splitting the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
